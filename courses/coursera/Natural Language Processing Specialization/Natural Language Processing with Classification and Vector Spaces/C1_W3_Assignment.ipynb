    "Euclidean distance between the original vectors and their projected siblings is\n",
    "minimal. Hence vectors that were originally close in the embeddings dictionary,\n",
    "will produce lower dimensional vectors that are still close to each other.\n",

    "Words like 'city', 'village', 'town' could be seen as synonyms and describe a\n",

    "1. Mean normalize the data\n",
