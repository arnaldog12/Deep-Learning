    "Welcome to the second programming assignment of Course 3. In this assignment, you will learn to build more complicated models with Tensorflow. By completing this assignment, you will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Design the architecture of a neural network, train it, and test it. \n",
    "- Process features and represents them\n",
    "- Understand word padding\n",
    "- Implement LSTMs\n",
    "- Test with your own sentence\n",

    "\n",
    "- All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!\n",

By default, `standardize = 'lower_and_strip_punctuation'`, this means the parser will remove all punctuation and make everything lowercase. Note that this may influence the NER task, since an upper case in the middle of a sentence may indicate an entity. Furthermore, the sentences in the dataset are already split into tokens, and all tokens, including punctuation, are separated by a whitespace. The punctuations are also labeled. That said, you will use `standardize = None` so everything will just be split into single tokens and then mapped to a positive integer.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Tensorflow has built-in functions for padding\n",

    "You will pad the vectorized labels with the value -1. You will not use 0 to simplify loss masking and evaluation in further steps. This is because to properly classify one token, a log softmax transformation will be performed and the index with greater value will be the index label. Since index starts at 0, it is better to keep the label 0 as a valid index, even though it is possible to also use 0 as a mask value for labels, but it would require some tweaks in the model architecture or in the loss computation.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- `sequences`: An array with the labels.\n",
    "- `padding`: The position where padding will take place, the standard is `pre`, meaning the sequences will be padded at the beginning. You need to pass the argument `post`.\n",

In such case, there is a need to perform an `argmax` for each prediction to find the appropriate predicted label.
