    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll delve into the world of text generation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Your primary objective is to predict the next set of characters based on the preceding ones. This seemingly straightforward task holds immense practicality in applications like predictive text and creative writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The journey unfolds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Preprocessing: You'll start by converting lines of text into numerical tensors, making them machine-readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dataset Creation: Next, you'll create a TensorFlow dataset, which will serve as the backbone for supplying data to your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Neural Network Training: Your model will be trained to predict the next set of characters, specifying the desired output length.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Character Embeddings: Character embeddings will be employed to represent each character as a vector, a fundamental technique in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- GRU Model: Your model utilizes a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to process character embeddings and make sequential predictions. The following figure gives you a summary of what you are about to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"images/model.png\" style=\"width:600px;height:150px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction Process: The model's predictions are achieved through a linear layer and log-softmax computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This overview sets the stage for your exploration of text generation. Get ready to unravel the secrets of language and embark on a journey into the realm of creative writing and predictive text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as usual let's start by importing all the required libraries."

    "\n",
    "  - Use the [`tf.strings.unicode_split`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/strings/unicode_split) function to split each sentence into its constituent characters.\n",
    "  - Utilize [`tf.keras.layers.StringLookup`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/StringLookup) to map these characters to integer values. This transformation lays the foundation for character-based modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- TensorFlow Dataset Creation: Create a TensorFlow dataset capable of producing data in batches. Each batch will consist of `batch_size` sentences, with each sentence containing a maximum of `max_length` characters. This organized dataset is essential for training your character generation model.\n",

You can do it using the `batch` function of the already created dataset. You must specify the length of the produced sequences (`seq_length + 1`). So, the sequence length produced by the dataset will `seq_length + 1`. It must have that extra element since you will get the input and the output sequences out of the same element. `drop_remainder=True` will drop the sequences that do not have the required length. This could happen each time that the dataset reaches the end of the input sequence.\n",

For instance, it tends to provide the same answer to a question consistently.\n",

When presented with an array of log scores for the N characters in your dictionary, you add an array of random numbers to this data.

By comparing the random numbers to the original input scores, the model adapts its choices, offering diversity in its outputs.\n",

Your model will not be able to encode information seen previously in the data set and as a result, the perplexity will increase. Remember from course 2 that the higher the perplexity, the worse your model is. Furthermore, statistical ngram models take up too much space and memory. As a result, they will be inefficient and too slow. Conversely, with deepnets, you can get a better perplexity. Note, learning about n-gram language models is still important and allows you to better understand deepnets.\n"
