    "# Question Answering with BERT and HuggingFace\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen how to use BERT and other transformer models for a wide range of natural language tasks, including machine translation, summarization, and question answering. Transformers have become the standard model for NLP, similar to convolutional models in computer vision. And all started with Attention!\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you'll rarely train a transformer model from scratch.  Transformers tend to be very large, so they take time, money, and lots of data to train fully. Instead, you'll want to start with a pre-trained model and fine-tune it with your dataset if you need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) (🤗) is the best resource for pre-trained transformers. Their open-source libraries simplify downloading and using transformer models like BERT, T5, and GPT-2. And the best part, you can use them alongside either TensorFlow, PyTorch or Flax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll use 🤗  transformers to use the DistilBERT model for question answering."

    "## Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Before fine-tuning a model, you will look at the pipelines from Hugging Face to use pre-trained transformer models for specific tasks. The `transformers` library provides pipelines for popular tasks like sentiment analysis, summarization, and text generation. A pipeline consists of a tokenizer, a model, and the model configuration. All these are packaged together into an easy-to-use object. Hugging Face makes life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines are intended to be used without fine-tuning and will often be immediately helpful in your projects. For example, `transformers` provides a pipeline for [question answering](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.QuestionAnsweringPipeline) that you can directly use to answer your questions if you give some context. Let's see how to do just that.\n",
